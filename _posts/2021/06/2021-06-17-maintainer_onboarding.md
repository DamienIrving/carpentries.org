The Carpentries is preparing to onboard the next round of maintainers.
[Currently](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/11) there are 161 maintainers across 54 core lessons.
To keep the community healthy,
we need to plan for people wanting to step down from their current positions and finding new people to take over.

The core lessons are currently in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/10);
relatively few number commits and changes have been made to the lessons the past years.
However, we are planning to move to a new lesson template and a new way to build the lessons without relying on Jekyll.
Over the next year,
there will be a bit more work making sure all existing issues and PRs are dealt with as the lesson transition over to the new template.

You do not need to be a Git guru to be a maintainer.
If you are familiar with the current [Carpentries Git materials](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/),
you will have the foundation and support to learn the [maintainer skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWhSYBkZJ0).
The Maintainers have their own Carpantries Slack group, and 2 monthly meetings to help support you and the lesson you are working on.

If you are interested in helping maintain, improve, and grow our lessons,
please apply to be a lesson maintainer here: XXXXXXXXXX
You will be asked to choose a technology (e.g., R, Python, etc)
and lesson content (e.g., geospatial, ecology, novice, etc) and we will do our best to match you to the correct lesson.

Applications will close XXXXXXXXXX.

Thanks,
The Carpentries Team
